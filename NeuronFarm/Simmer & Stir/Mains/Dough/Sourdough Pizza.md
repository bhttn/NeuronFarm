## Ingredients

QTY | List
---:|---
432g | White Flour
48g | Spelt Flour
322g | Water
9g | Salt
72g | Sourdough Starter

## Method
1. In your mixing bowl measure out the called for water minus 50g and add your mature starter; swish around with a whisk or spatula to disperse. Then add in flour, salt, and malt and mix a bit with your hand (so when you turn on your mixer dry flour doesn’t eject out dusting you head to toe). Attach the dough hook to your mixer and turn on speed #2 (for a KitchenAid) and mix for a few minutes until everything comes together. Once it is a single dry mass dribble in the remaining 50g water over the course of a minute or two while mixing, waiting to add more water until the previous liquid is absorbed. 
2. At 75-77°F (23-25°C) ambient temperature, bulk fermentation should go for about 2.5 hours. Perform 3-4 sets of stretch and folds — a North, South, East, and West fold for each set – during the bulk, spaced out by 30 minutes. 
3. After 2.5 hours in bulk, use some olive oil and lightly oil a bowl large enough to hold the dough. Then, dump the dough out onto the counter and using two hands shape the dough into a very tight boule. It’s important here to get the dough nice and taut, don’t worry about degassing.Wrap the bowl with reusable plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator overnight.
4. Remove the bulk container with the dough from the refrigerator and dump the dough out onto your un-floured bench. Divide the dough into two 290g dough balls and using almost no flour form each into a very tight ball. It’s incredibly important here to create a ball that has a completely closed bottom. You want a tight skin on each of these that completely surrounds the dough ball.
5. Once the balls are shaped and onto the proof vessel cover with plastic wrap so they do not dry out during proof (this is why a high-walled dish works well, it keeps the wrap off of the dough). The balls will proof on the counter, around 75°F (23°C), for about 6 hours.
6. Thirty minutes before you plan to bake the first pizza toss your entire proofing vessel with dough into the refrigerator. It’s so, so much easier to shape out the dough when it’s cold from the fridge and I find that there is no need to let the dough warm to room temperature before baking. This is optional but recommended.
