## Ingredients

QTY | Desc
---|---
350g | plain flour
2tsp | cream of tartar
1tsp | bicarbonate soda
½ tsp | salt
300g | granulated sugar
220g | unsalted butter
2 | large eggs
2tsp | pure vanilla extract

## Method
To make the snickerdoodle dough grab a bowl and mix together the cream of tartar, salt, bicarbonate of soda and flour until well combined.

In a separate larger bowl beat together the sugar and butter with an electric whisk until light and fluffy. Add in the eggs and vanilla extract and whizz away until just combined.

Now add the dry ingredients to the beaten egg mixture, adding slowly in about 4-5 batches. The mixture will thicken as you go, keep whisking until just combined and smooth.

To make the cinnamon sugar, mix together the 2tbsp cinnamon and 50g sugar in a bowl and leave to one side.

Going back to the batter, grab an ice cream scoop and scoop up the dough, roll a ball with your hands of the dough and then place in the cinnamon sugar. Once coated all over place on a lined baking tray spread apart. Repeat with all the dough using extra lined trays as necessary.

Bake for 10minutes in an oven pre-heated to 180fan/200c/400f trying to just get the outer edges firmed and the middle looking a little softer, cracks are fine though, allow to cool fully before eating.
