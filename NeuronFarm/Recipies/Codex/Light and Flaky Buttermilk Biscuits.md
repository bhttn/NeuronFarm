## Ingredients 

QTY | Desc
---: |---
1 cup | buttermilk, chilled
225g | unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch cubes and chilled
525g |all-purpose flour
4 tsp | baking powder
½ tsp | fine sea salt
250ml | heavy cream, chilled, plus ¼ cup more for brushing biscuits

## Method
1. Preheat the oven to 230°C. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Freeze the buttermilk and butter for 15 minutes.
3. Place the flour, baking powder, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fit with the paddle attachment and mix at low speed until combined, about 30 seconds.
4. Add in half of the butter, a few pieces at a time, and continue mixing at low speed until the mixture looks sandy and no distinct pieces of butter are visible, about 8 minutes.
5. Add the rest of the butter and continue mixing until the butter pieces are the size of large peas, about 4 minutes.
6. Transfer the mixture to a large, wide bowl and very briefly use your fingers to flatten the largest butter piece.
7. Create a well in the center of the mixture. Pour ¾ cup buttermilk and 1 cup cream into the well. Mix with a rubber spatula using broad, circular strokes. 
8. Add up to ¼ cup more buttermilk as needed to bring dough roughly together (it's fine if the dough remains shagey)
9. Lightly flour the counter and turn the dough out of the bowl. Gently pat the dough out into a 2 cm -thick rectangle, about 20 cm by 30 cm. 
10. Fold the dough in half, then fold it again, then fold it a third time, then use a rolling pin to gently roll the dough back out to a 2 cm thick rectangle, about 20 cm by 30 cm. 
11. Lightly flour the counter and roll the dough to a height of about 3 cm
12.  Cut straight down with a 6 cm biscuit cutter, wiping and flouring the cutter between each cut. This will ensure the biscuits rise straight up, instead of sloping over. 
13. Reroll the scraps once and cut remaining dough into biscuits.
14. Place the biscuits about ½ inch apart on the prepared baking sheets and brush the tops generously with cream. 
15. Bake for 8 minutes, then rotate pans and switch their oven positions. 
16. Continue baking another 8 to 10 minutes, until the biscuits are golden brown and feel light when picked up.
17. Transfer biscuits to a wire rack and cool for 5 minutes. Serve warm.

### To freeze 
the biscuits for up to 6 weeks, freeze cut biscuits in a single layer on
a baking sheet until solid then transfer to plastic freezer bag and freeze. To bake, do not
defrost. Brush frozen biscuits with cream and bake for 1o minutes at 450 F and io to
12 minutes at 375°F.
