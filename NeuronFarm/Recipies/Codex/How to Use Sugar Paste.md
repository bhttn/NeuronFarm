1. Make sure that your mould is clean and dry before use.
2. Place your mould on a firm, flat surface, take a smooth crease free ball of your sugarpaste or other medium.
3. Press the chosen medium into your mould, working over all areas paying particular attention to any deeper parts.
4. Remove any excess paste using your fingers or a palette knife and flatten the back.
5. Gently squeeze across the top of the mould so that your paste comes away from the edges slightly.
6. Turn the mould over and gently rub the back.
7. Your decoration should just fall out.
8. Leave to dry completely before decorating.
* for using with other mediums please refer to
the manufactures instructions and remember NEVER use the same mould for edible and non edible mediums

## Hints & Tips
If you find that your paste is sticking, try dusting the mould with a little corn flour, or if you prefer you can grease the mould using a little white fat.
Whilst some of the moulds can be used with straight roll out icing, many of them need a modelling paste. I make my own by mixing 1 tsp of CMC / Tylo powder with 250g of shop bought roll out icing. Give the icing a quick blast in the microwave to soften, knead in the CMC well and leave to rest for at least 30 minutes.

Wash when needed in warm soapy water and dry thoroughly before re using
