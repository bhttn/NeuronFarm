## Ingredients

QTY | Ingredient
---|---
219g |  all-purpose flour
62g | unsweetened natural cocoa powder
350g | granulated sugar
2 tsp | baking soda
1 tsp | baking powder
1 tsp | salt
2 tsp | espresso powder
120ml | vegetable oil
2  | large **eggs**, at room temperature
2 tsp | pure vanilla extract
240ml | buttermilk, at room temperature
240ml | freshly brewed strong hot coffee

## Method
1. Preheat oven to 180°C. 
2. Grease two 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. 
3. Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and espresso powder (if using) together in a large bowl. Set aside. 
4. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment mix the oil, eggs, and vanilla together on medium-high speed until combined. 
5. Add the buttermilk and mix until combined. 
6. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, add the hot water/coffee, and whisk or beat on low speed until the batter is completely combined. Batter is thin.
7. Divide batter evenly between pans. 
8. Bake for 23-26 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Baking times vary, so keep an eye on yours. The cakes are done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. _(**Note:** Even if they’re completely done, the cooled cakes may *slightly* sink in the center. Cocoa powder is simply not as structurally strong as all-purpose flour and can’t hold up to all the moisture necessary to make a moist tasting chocolate cake. It’s normal!)_
9. Remove the cakes from the oven and set on a wire rack. Allow to cool completely in the pan.
