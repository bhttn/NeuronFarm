**For the gyoza filling:**

-   1/3 lb (150 g) ground pork
-   2 green nira, (garlic chives) (0.7 oz, 20 g )
-   5 oz cabbage (2-3 leaves)

**Seasonings for the gyoza filling:**

-   1 clove garlic, minced
-   1 knob ginger (2cm, grated)
-   1 Tbsp (15 ml) cooking sake
-   1 tsp sesame oil
-   1 Tbsp soy sauce
-   1/2 tsp salt
-   1/2 tsp sugar
-   1/8 tsp pepper

**Gyoza Dipping Sauce:**

-   1 Tbsp Soy sauce
-   1 Tbsp rice vinegar
-   Drizzle of Ra-Yu (Japanese Chili Oil)

## Directions:

1. Mix flour, salt and water in a mixing bowl and knead for 15 to 20 minutes. Then let the dough rest in the bowl for one (1) hour.

2. Make balls of dough about 1inch (2.54cm) in diameter and then use a rolling pin to flatten each ball into a circle about 4inch (10 cm) in diameter. These are your gyoza wrappers! Sprinkle some flour/cornstarch on each wrapper and stack, covering with a damp kitchen towel until ready for use.

3. Finely chop the cabbage and chives and add the salt.

4. In another large bowl, combine the cabbage, chives and ground pork. Then, add all of the seasonings (see list above) and mix well. This will be your gyoza filling.

5. Using a small spoon, place the a small ball of filling onto each dough circle. 

6. Wet your fingertips in a bowl of water and moisten the edge of each circle. Fold the dough in half (like a taco) but do not completely seal it. Using your thumb and index finger, bunch up the top edge of the dough once every couple of centimeters- moving from one side to the other. As you fold each bunch, press the folded dough tightly against the back part of the wrapper using your other thumb and index finger. Your finished product should look similar to the gyoza below.

7. Put oil (preferably sesame) in a frying pan and heat over medium heat. Add the gyoza (as many as can fit flat in your pan). Cook until the underside of the gyoza turn a golden brown. 

8. Then, add a tablespoon of water, cover the pan with a lid and let the gyoza steam. Cooking is complete when all the water has evaporated.

9. Remove the gyoza from the pan and enjoy with dipping sauce!
