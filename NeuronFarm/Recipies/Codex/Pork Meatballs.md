Serves 4
## Ingredients
1 kg Pilton Valley Premium Pork mince
1 medium red onion, grated
1 large carrot, peeled and grated
1 cup panko breadcrumbs
2 tablespoons tomato sauce
2 tablespoons barbecue sauce
1 large zucchini
1/3 cup plain flour
1 tablespoon olive oil
¾ cup grated 4 cheese melt or mozzarella cheese
Chopped cherry tomatoes, oven fries
and tomato sauce, to serve

## Method
1. Preheat oven to 200°C/180°C fan-forced. Line a large baking tray with baking paper.
2. Place Pilton Valley Premium Pork mince, onion, carrot, breadcrumbs, tomato sauce and barbecue sauce into a large bowl. Grate zucchini and firmly squeeze in your
hands to remove liquid. Add zucchini to pork mixture. Stir
until combined. Season with salt and pepper. Roll mixture
into 12 large round rissoles. Lightly coat rissoles with flour
and place on a tray.
3. Heat oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Cook
rissoles, turning often, for 8-10 minutes or until evenly
browned. Transfer to prepared baking tray. Bake for 10
minutes or until cooked through.
4. Sprinkle rissoles with grated cheese. Bake for 5 minutes
or until cheese has melted. Serve rissoles with tomatoes,
oven-fries and tomato sauce.
