## Ingredients

| QTY | Ingredient |
| --- | ---------- |
|201 g | plain flour
|24 g | caster sugar
|2.4 tsp | baking powder
|198 ml | milk , full fat, slightly warmed
|90g | unsalted butter , melted and slightly cooled
|2 | large eggs , at room temperature
|½ tsp | vanilla essence
|-| Pinch cooking / kosher salt

## Method

1. **Whisk dry -** Place the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a large mixing bowl. Whisk to mix.
2. **Whisk in wet -** Add milk, eggs and vanilla. Whisk to combine. Add melted butter then whisk until lump free. The batter should be pourable but thick - slightly thinner than pancakes.
3. **Recommended resting** Cover then refrigerate overnight, or for at least 2 hours. Softer insides, better flavour. Else, proceed immediately with cooking.
4. **Preheat** a waffle maker. A non stick one will not need oil, plus there is butter in the batter.
5. **Cooking -** Use a ladle to pour batter in to just cover the iron. Don't get greedy - it will leak out the sides! Cook until golden and crisp - my good waffle iron takes 3 1/2 minutes, my Kmart one takes 6 minutes.
6. **Serving -** Transfer onto plates and serve as you go, with desired toppings. Or, put on a rack and keep warm in a preheated 70°C/150°F oven while you continue cooking!
