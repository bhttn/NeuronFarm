## Quinoa

Technically, [quinoa](https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Quinoa-Vegan-Non-GMO-Protein/dp/B073ZNGZ7F/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ac_md=0-0-cXVpbm9h-ac_d_rm&038;crid=3MG53D3RJ8VRO&keywords=quinoa&pd_rd_i=B073ZNGZ7F&pd_rd_r=8e9ef0c5-e501-4f23-a628-30ea21a6bda3&pd_rd_w=NrRVs&pd_rd_wg=RJyBJ&pf_rd_p=983984df-2ad2-4c97-ba7f-4c5a90291c2b&pf_rd_r=WM7FRP00EBMDRS7WESA8&psc=1&qid=1570192806&sprefix=quion,aps,218&linkCode=ll1&tag=camdenxpsc-20&linkId=866e8340dca13590dfaecee80db0f7a9&language=en_US&asc_source=browser&asc_refurl=https://www.popsci.com/gadgets/vegan-high-protein-foods) is a seed, and a cup of it cooked boasts 8 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber, plus potassium and iron. It’s cheap, filling, vegan, and the perfect base layer to top with vegetables, nutritional yeast, tofu, sriracha, or whatever else floats your boat.

## Legumes (Lentils)

A cup of cooked [lentils](https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Green-Lentils-Pounds-Sproutable/dp/B0747TJCVP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=dry+lentils+bulk&038;qid=1571674526&sr=8-7&linkCode=ll1&tag=camdenxpsc-20&linkId=6211d5dee5ba976fa10f50b9729b61f3&language=en_US&asc_source=browser&asc_refurl=https://www.popsci.com/gadgets/vegan-high-protein-foods) holds around 18 grams of protein, or about what’s in three large eggs. It also boasts 16 grams of dietary fiber. Cook them with coconut milk, tomato paste, onion, and spices like curry powder, cumin, and coriander.

## Texturized Vegetable Protein (TVP)

it’s an excellent meat substitute to incorporate into pasta sauces, stews, chilis, taco fillings and more. It’s economical and easy to prepare: reconstitute the particles in boiling water and then use it in recipes as you would any browned ground beef. It offers 12 grams of protein per serving (a quarter-cup dry).
