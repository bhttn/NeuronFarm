The Bunya nut may be used in many ways. The nuts can be eaten raw or
cooked. It is considered advisable by some to remove the centre yellow piece from
the nut. Bunya nuts can be sliced when raw, frozen and later used in casseroles or
as a vegetable on its own.
# COOKING BUNYA NUTS IN SHELLS
## BOILED
Boil a quantity of water in a large saucepan. When boiling vigorously add Bunya nuts. Boil for 30 minutes. Salt may be added to the water. This gives a very slight salty taste to the nuts. Drain, then split open while hot. Remove from shells and serve with butter or butter and salt, according to taste. Nuts may also be eaten cold. For extra flavour, Bunya nuts can be boiled with corned beef, or boiled in water left from cooking corned beef, and can be left in the salt water over night.
## BAKED
Before baking nuts, cut the tip of the shell so that the shell will start to split when it is hot. Bake in oven at 200 degrees for 20 minutes, or until ends split. Often they explode when ready. Remove from shell and eat while hot. Nuts can also be placed in hot coals of a barbecue or camp fire for a few minutes. Ensure tips have been cut or nuts will explode.

## MICROWAVE
Snip pointed ends off shells to allow air to escape. Place nuts in a plastic bag or covered container. Microwave for 5 minutes. Do not overcook as nuts will explode. Cool before opening. Split open and serve with butter, salt and pepper.
# COOKING BUNYA NUTS WITHOUT SHELLS
The easiest way to shell nuts is to halve them using a guillotine, or by inserting a
sharp, pointed knife in the narrow end and split downwards. Then cut the nut in half
and remove the yellow centre kernel.

## BOILED
Cut nuts in half and boil for 10 minutes.
## SAUTE 
Sauté sliced nuts in hot garlic butter, salt and pepper. Cook for a few seconds only - do not overcook. Serve while hot.

Bunya nuts may become tough if cooked twice, or cooked for too long.

Bunya nuts can be substituted in most recipes where peanuts, macadamias, pecans etc. are used, but pre-cook Bunya nuts.
