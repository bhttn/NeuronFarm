7.  Top the shortbread with a generous sprinkling of more demerara sugar.
8.  Bake for 1 - 1.5 hours  or until the top is set and has become lightly golden. 
9.  Allow the shortbread to cool for 10-15 minutes
10.  While still warm, cut the cookies to the desired size using a thin knife. 
11.  Allow the cookies to cool in the pan for a minimum of 4 hours or up to overnight.
    
12.  Once the cookies are completely cooled, serve with your choice of warm beverage or cover in plastic wrap. The cookies can be kept at room temperature for up to 2 days.
