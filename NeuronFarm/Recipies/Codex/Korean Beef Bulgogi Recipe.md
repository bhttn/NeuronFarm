**Yield:** 4-6 servings
# Ingredients 
700g |  boneless rib eye steak
 1/2 small pear, peeled and coarsely grated
-   1/4 cup reduced sodium soy sauce
-   2 tablespoons light brown sugar
-   2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
-   3 cloves garlic, minced
-   1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
-   1 tablespoon gochujang (Korean red pepper paste)
-   2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
-   2 green onions, thinly sliced
-   1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds
# Method
1.  Wrap steak in plastic wrap, and place in the freezer for 30 minutes. Unwrap and slice across the grain into 1/4-inch thick slices.
2.  In a medium bowl, combine pear, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, garlic, ginger and gochujang. In a gallon size Ziploc bag, combine soy sauce mixture and steak; marinate for at least 2 hours to overnight, turning the bag occasionally.
3.  Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a cast iron grill pan over medium-high heat.* Working in batches, add steak to the grill pan in a single layer and cook, flipping once, until charred and cooked through, about 2-3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and steak.
4.  Serve immediately, garnished with green onions and sesame seeds, if desired.
