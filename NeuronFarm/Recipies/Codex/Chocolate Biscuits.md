---: | ---
135g | Plain flour                 
10 g | Cocoa powder                
½ tsp|  Bicarbonate of soda
½ tsp  | Salt
115g    | Cold unsalted butter, cubed
130g    | Unrefined caster sugar

### Method

1. Pre-heat the oven to 190C.
2. Sift the flour, cocoa powder, bicarbonate of soda and salt together into a bowl, and set to one side.
3. Using a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar on medium speed until the mixture becomes light and fluffy (approximately 5 minutes).
4. Reduce the speed of the mixer to low, then add the flour mixture to the mixing bowl. Continue to mix until the dough comes together.
5. Using an ice-cream scoop, portion the dough into balls (approximately 40g per ball). Place them on a parchment lined baking tray roughly 10cm apart.
6. Place the tray in the oven for 10 minutes.
7. Allow to cool on the tray for 2 minutes before placing the biscuits on a cooling rack to cool completely.
8. The biscuits will keep for up to 5 days in an airtight tin.
