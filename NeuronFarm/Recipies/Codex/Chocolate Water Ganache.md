## Ingredients

QTY | Ing
---|---
250g | chocolate
100ml | water
1 tsp | coffee, optional

## Method
1. Place the water and the chocolate into the top of a double-boiler and melt, stirring to mix the two ingredients.
2. Once the chocolate is all melted, keep heating and stirring the ganache to let some of the water evaporate.

## Cool Down
If you are going to drizzle the ganache over a cake, wait about half an hour for the ganache to cool down and then pour it over the cake.  If you are going to spread it onto a cake, wait until the ganache is the consistency of peanut butter and then spread/pipe it onto your cake.  Don’t put it in the fridge to cool down, though, as this will make the ganache set!

## Storage
If you are intending to keep the ganache, place it in a clean mason jar and keep it in the fridge. The ganache will become very stiff once refrigerated so if you want to use it as an ice-cream sauce later on, just spoon out a little bit and blast it in the microwave for a few seconds to make it nice and runny again.

## Adding Alcohol
Make the ganache as stipulated above, heat some alcohol in the microwave for 10 seconds, and then mix the two.
