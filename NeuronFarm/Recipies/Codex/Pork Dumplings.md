---|---
1 tablespoon |extra virgin olive oil
1 cup (90g) |finely shredded Chinese cabbage (wombok)
1 tablespoon | oyster sauce
200g | pork mince
1 |eggwhite
1 tbsp | hoisin sauce
2 teaspoons | finely grated ginger
24 | gow gee wrappers (dumpling pastry)

## Method
1. Place the oil in a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat. 
2. Add the cabbage and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, for 5 minutes or until the cabbage is soft. 
3. Add the oyster sauce, stir and set aside to cool.
4. Place the pork, eggwhite, hoisin and ginger in a big bowl. Add the cooled cabbage and mix well to combine.
5. Place 6 of the gow gee wrappers on a clean, dry surface and, using a pastry brush, brush the edges with a little water.
6. Place 2 teaspoons of the pork mixture in the centre of each wrapper. Fold the edges over, pressing with your fingertips, to seal.
7. Repeat to make 24 dumplings.
8. Using scissors, cut a round of non-stick baking paper to fit the base of a large bamboo steamer. Fold the paper in half 4 times to make a narrow triangle. Snip some tiny triangles along the folded edge. Open the paper and there should be lots of little holes for letting steam through. 
9. Place the paper in the steamer with 12 of the dumplings on top. Cover with the lid and carefully place the steamer over a large saucepan of rapidly simmering water. Steam for 8-10 minutes or until the pork is cooked through.
STEP 5 Wearing oven gloves (steam is super hot), carefully remove the dumplings from the steamer with tongs and keep them warm. Repeat with the remaining dumplings.
Serve with some soy and chilli sauce for dipping. MAKES 24
