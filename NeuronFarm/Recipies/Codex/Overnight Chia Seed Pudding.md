3/4 cup | milk
1 tbsp | maple syrup or honey
1 tsp | pure vanilla extract
3 tbsp | chia seeds

## Method
1. In any glass container with a tight seal lid, add ingredients in the following order: milk, maple syrup, vanilla and chia seeds. If you would like to add toppings in the morning, use bigger jars, otherwise use smaller jars (pictured).
2. Stir well with a spoon or fork, let sit for 1 minute and stir 2 more times. This will prevent lumps. 
3. Then refrigerate overnight.
4. When ready to eat, stir well and top with favourite toppings: nuts, berries, fruit, coconut flakes etc.
