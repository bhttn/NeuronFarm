## Ingredients 

QTY | Ing
---:|---
700g | chicken 
1 | onion
2 |garlic cloves
1/2 cup | (200g) yoghurt or milk
3 tbsp |vegetable oil
2 tbsp |tomato paste
1 tsp |freshly ground black pepper
1 tsp |paprika
1 tsp |kosher salt

## Method
1. Cut the meat into 1-inch pieces. Set aside.
2. Using the finest grater possible, grate the onion and garlic cloves over a medium bowl.
3. Pour the pulp and juice into a fine mesh strainer and, using a wooden spoon, press out the juice into a medium bowl. Discard the onion and garlic pulp; reserve the juice.
4. Stir together the onion-garlic juice, yogurt, oil, tomato paste, black pepper, paprika, and salt.
5. Add the cubed chicken and toss to coat.
6. Cover the bowl and refrigerate it for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight for maximum flavor.
7. Prepare a medium (175°C to 190°C) gas or charcoal grill fire.
8. Remove the chicken pieces from the marinade and thread them onto soaked bamboo kebab skewers or metal skewers. The chunks of chicken can touch each other, but don’t put them too close together to ensure they cook through. Discard any remaining marinade.
9. Sprinkle the kebabs generously with salt and place on pre heated grill. Grill evenly on all sides, about 12 minutes total.
10. Garnish with sumac, dried oregano, and paprika, if desired, and serve.
