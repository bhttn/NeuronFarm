# Monday 19th August
Got the chance to hire my first person today. Scary but exciting. Still feeling off but way better than yesterday so I have no idea what was wrong as it doesn’t feel like an illness. 
Bradley was very excited when he got home because he won at the science fair for his year level and came home with a huge prize bag. It’s a shame Brandon didn’t get anything but it is nice that Bradley got recognised for his hard work.
