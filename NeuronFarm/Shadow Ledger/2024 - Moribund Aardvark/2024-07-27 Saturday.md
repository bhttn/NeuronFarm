# Saturday 27th July
Spent the morning getting ready for the park as we decided to go early to have lunch and a play before the party.  Running late as usual and the park was supper busy. Had a decent time and the kids had a lot of fun. 
Picked up pizza on the way home and found out there is going to be a new Turkish place at Holmview. Watched MIB 2 for movie night which still holds up.
