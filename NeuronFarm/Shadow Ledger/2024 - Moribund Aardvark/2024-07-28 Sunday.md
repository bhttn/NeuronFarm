# Sunday 28th July

Got a good run to make it to the Mt Gravatt show just after it opened at 9. First stop was the Lego which Bradley was in love with going around everything twice. Motorbike jumping, dog jumping and the dinosaur ventriloquist show where also highlights. Bradley's absolute favourite thing from the day was getting to go into the "puppy cuddle" arena. He managed very well with most of the dogs asleep and he even got the courage to hold one by the end. Brandon also had a good time with all the poodles. 
Brandon was a bit disappointed that he couldn't get a show bag (as none of them where very good) but we made up for it with some hot wheel cars and cool badges. All in all a good day and I am glad we went.
