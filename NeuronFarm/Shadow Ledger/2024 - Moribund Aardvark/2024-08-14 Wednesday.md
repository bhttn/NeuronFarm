# Wednesday 14th August
Perfect rainy day to stay in bed and watch TV, all the better that I could do it with Benita as we both had the day off. Dropped Brandon's science diorama off managing to keep it dry on the way! I have started looking properly at bathroom places so hopefully we can start on that soon.
