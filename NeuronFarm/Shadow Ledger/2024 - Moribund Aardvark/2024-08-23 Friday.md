# Friday 23rd August

Brandon enjoyed all his presents, Lego police crime truck, GShock watch, and a stick sculpture thing. He seemed happy to have a quiet morning at home. Spent it building his Lego then we went out to Yatala Pies fans Baskin and Robins for lunch. so full from lunch no one except Bradley ate all their piece of cake. Finished up the day watch Godzilla vs Kong.
