# Tuesday 27th August
It has been awhile since I have had a day as relaxing as this. Definitely one of the best birthdays I have had, the only issues being that I have to keep the Baradur set secret as the Gibson’s have already bought it for my 40th and the lamingtons being mouldy. 

Benita got me Wall E / Eve and Gandlaf / Balrog Lego and Bradley was very sweet and gave me one of his prizes from the science competition.
