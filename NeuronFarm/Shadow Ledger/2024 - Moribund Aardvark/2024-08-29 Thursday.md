# Thursday 29th August
Made really good progress on planning for Melbourne today, starting to get excited as long as mum stops going in about gelato. Bradley had a great time at the colour run and was very excited when he got home. Finally gave in an ordered a walking pad so hopefully Benita actually uses it. The Looney Tunes walking medal came today which looks just as good as I had hoped.
