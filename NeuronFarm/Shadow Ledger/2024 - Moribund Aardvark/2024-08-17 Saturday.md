# Saturday 17th August

Excellent lunch with Benita at a Korean pork hock place at Underwood after looking at bathroom vanities. 
Both kids seemed to have fun with David at the Cars & coffee day he took them too. It was good to see him spend some quality time with them. 
Met a very friendly dog on my walk this afternoon that wanted to play. I was worried when I saw it coming up the unfenced driveway but it kept its distance and went and found a stick that it dropped for me. After throwing the stick it was happy to go play by itself and went home after I had passed the house. 
Skipped movie night but still had pizzas as the boys were too tired and silly to make it through a movie. We did finish Exploding Kittens and I finished reading Equal Rites with Brandon.
