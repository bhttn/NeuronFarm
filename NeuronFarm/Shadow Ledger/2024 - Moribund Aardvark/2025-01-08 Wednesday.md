# Wednesday 8th January

### Operation Ouch Live Show
Kids enjoyed the show with it going into great detail on how our intestines work, why we fart, live endoscope demonstration in the mouth and nose and how to deal with embarrassment while telling a story about capturing dinosaur farts. Well put together shown even if it did jump around story wise.
