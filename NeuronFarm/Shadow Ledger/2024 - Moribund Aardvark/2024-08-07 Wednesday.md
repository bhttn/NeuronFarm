# Wednesday 7th August
Another 2 hours of meetings today just when I was hoping for a quieter day. I did have my first meeting with David to start formalising my move into team lead which is exciting. Haven't been able to spend much time with Benita this week with the way everything has unfolded. 
Received the new in ground basketball hoop today.
