# Monday 15th July

Thankfully a quiet day at worked today but still wiped me out by this afternoon. A bitterly cold day that only became bearable this afternoon. The kids half cleaned up inside the car and I half did the outside, so we still have a mess of a car but now at least it's a presentable mess. 
**Exploding Kittens** started strong and so far nothing that I wouldn't want the kids to see, not sure why it is rated MA so far. 
Nice evening with Benita as both boys went to bed easily tonight.
