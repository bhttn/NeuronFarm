# Friday 2nd August

Quiet day today as Benita was out for most of it looking for plasticine of all things. Who knew it was so hard to get! Andrea has talked with David about me taking over so we are having a meeting next week to discuss. It sounds like the new grads will be under me soon. 
Brandon lost a tooth today and asked the tooth fairy for a Minecraft bag. Tooth fairy doesn't take request these days but will still leave a note of asked. 
Bradley is excited about going to the Paw Patrol show tomorrow which is nice.
