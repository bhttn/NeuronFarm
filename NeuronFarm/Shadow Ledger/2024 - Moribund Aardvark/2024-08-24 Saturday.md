# Saturday 24th August
Productive day kicking off small things around the house. Disappointing trip to the Hyperdome as I couldn’t find any of the toys I was looking for. I did find a Taz dressed as flash which was cool but not enough to buy. 
Brandon enjoyed his birthday dinner with his grandparents at Grill’d and was happy with the chess Lego set he got. 
The upside of having another late night is both kids where tired by the time they went to be so Benita and I got to spend some time together for once.
