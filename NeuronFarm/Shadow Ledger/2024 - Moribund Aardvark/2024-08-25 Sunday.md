# Sunday 25th August
Earlier start then I wanted as Bradley woke me up at 7 looking for the iPad (which was already in the lounge room). Another quietly productive day cleaning up the pantry today. Watched Barbie which was as good as I expected it to be. Found some more time tonight after the kids where in bed to help Benita relax this time.
