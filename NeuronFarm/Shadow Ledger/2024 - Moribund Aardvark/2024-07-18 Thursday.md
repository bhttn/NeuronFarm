# Thursday 18th July


Finally a chill day at home. Didn't plan n getting to much done as it is still so cold. Instead spent most of the day watching TV with Benita. Watched **Ride the Eagle** with lunch which was much better than I was expecting. A very straight forward story that sticks to the basics of the plot but executes everything it does well.
