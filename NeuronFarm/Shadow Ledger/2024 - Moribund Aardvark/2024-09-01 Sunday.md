# Sunday 1st September

A quiet Father’s Day this year as Brandon was sick last. Benita cooked croissants for breakfast, Brandon drew me a cool taz / balrog card, and Bradley drew a good portrait of me in his card. Brandon got me a new oven mitt, a wooden chopping board and a pack of coupons. Bradley got me a pen, a bouncy ball, and a travel mug. 

Bradley and I had morning tea with dad so we could have the cake that we all cooked yesterday and to give him his Lego space penguin. Had some fun building the Lego Baleog while Benita built the Lego Eve and Bradley helped sort out the pieces and playing the Art of Rally on the switch. All in all a pretty good day.
