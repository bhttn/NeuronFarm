**New Hominin Species Found:** 40 km outside of Johannesburg, South Africa in the Rising Star Cave, at a site known as the Cradle of Humankind cavers have discovered fossils of a new Hominin species, Homo naledi.

In 2013 a team of cavers surveying the chambers of the cave system found an unmaped whole 18 cm wide leading to a new cave, symbols carved into the walls dated the finds to be between 241,000–335,000 years old. 

Anthropologist Berger hired an additional team of six women with both scientific and caving experience to excavate the site (using toothpicks and sometimes porcupine quills, among other tools)

Access to the site required going down a chute using a technique known as the *Superman's Crawl* because most cavers can only manage to squeeze through by extending one arm above the head while holding the other tight against the body. The chute was on average a 12m long and 20 cm wide.

Berger was careful not to claim the fossils found were anactual burial at the time of discovery. However they identified depressions deep in the chambers of the cave system, in which the bodies of _H. naledi_ adults and several young children had been deposited in a fetal position, suggesting that the intent was to bury the dead. Berger concluded that "we feel they've met the litmus test of the most ancient human burials."
