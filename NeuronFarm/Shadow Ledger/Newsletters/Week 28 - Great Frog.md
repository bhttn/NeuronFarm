## Entertainment
**The Bear:** I love the way the show holds shots long enough to make you uncomfortable especially in the wider shots when people are talking to each other
**Silo:** For a high concept show the characters are really the stars of the story
**[[A Waltz for Matilda]]:** Finally picked this up again, it took me awhile to recover from all the truma in the first quarter. I hope that it is happier from here but I fear not. 
**Thor Ragnorok:** The movie still stands out amount the Marvel movies by having some actual depth to the characters. It is a shame that the warriors three couldn't have been used more. It would have been nice if the next movies could have kept up this momentum instead of throwing it away.

## Around Town
**Movie Night:** Cancelled because of "undesirables" nearby. Strange that the police didn't move them on as we where outside the station. 
**Hyperdome Butcher:** On to a winner going here, going to try and make it work that I go here fortnightly. 
**Family Dinner:** Fish & chips at mum & dads as we hadn't seen them for awhile and we walked past at an opportune time. 
**Family Walk:** We all went for a walk up Tawonga Road on a glorious Sunday morning. Brad and I made it to the top, Brandon almost made and Benita ran out of steam half way up. Besides Brad getting scared by the scary dogs a nice morning out. 

## Work
It was a quiet week as I focused on catching up on clearing out my emails and tidying up my personal notes vault.
