## Entertainment
**Wylah - Custodians:** Did not enjoy reading this, it is not written to be read aloud and with the large cast of characters to keep track of, semi switching between first and third person, and the unpolished writing overshadowed the interesting enough story and different perspective of a First Nation story.

**Formula 1: Singapore** Wow what a race, from the early VSC to Sainz helping Norris holding of the Mercs to Russell binning it on the last lap a fantastic race. 

**Zelda Tears of the Kingdom** 110 hours in I definitely got my monies worth. The polish and care makes the game transcend the lacklustre story & gameplay into something special. The organic funny moments and endless exploration that is constantly rewarded keeps the game going far beyond what it should on paper. 
A special time with the kids that I will miss now that it is over.

## Hobbies
**Heat Pedal to the Metal** A simple game with more interesting desicions as it goes on. Can' wait until we can play it again.
