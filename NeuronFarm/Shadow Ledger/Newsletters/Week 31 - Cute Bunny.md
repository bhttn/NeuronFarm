## Personal
**Cold Season:** I have been hit again this cold season after Benita and Brad got it last week. It hasn't been to bad except for the lack of sleep. Having wedensday off really helped in it being manageable.
**Cello Workshop:** Unfortunatly Bran did not make it despite our best efforts to keep him away from Brad. Thankfully he recovered pretty quick this time with only the two days off school.

## Hobbies
**Wooden Clocktower:** Looking for something quieter and less physical I painted and built a little wooden clock tower model. The sparkly blue and brass paints turned out really well with flat red accents. It looks as good as I was hoping so can't wait to do more.
**Lord of the Rings:**  Looking for something easy to learn to start to get into the habit of playing again I have picked up my old LotR soundtrack pieces again. It is very satisfying to be able to learn a song so quickly after struggling through some of the Hamilton songs.

## HQ
**Back Garden:** Relieved that the current round of gardening is coming to a close. Connned the kids into helping choose some plants to finish up the garden and conned dad into helping me cut down some trees to close to the house. 
**Hill Grass:** Trying some native grasses to cover the hill and help hold it together. Will it work? Will I keep them alive long enough to find out? Who knows, but at least it is a start.
