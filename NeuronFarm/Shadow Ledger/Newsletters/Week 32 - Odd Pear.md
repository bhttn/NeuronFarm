## Entertainmnet
**Silo Season 1:** This show is so tense with the uncertainty of what is coming next but with the knowledge that it will be earned and that the a pay off is coming. So many small threads that could have been throw away world building details come together nicely in the final episodes. The acting, writing, cinematography and set design all come together beautifully to support the tension at the core of the show.

**The Addams Family Musical Comedy:** A heartwarming and funny look at the challenges of marriage and navigating how you fit into your family and the world as you grow up. The perfect use of of comedy and the zanieness of the Addams family to look at issues that we all face. The adaption to a musical is well done with how important music is to the original series it provided a natural transition to the songs.
A bigger cast than I was expecting with the full Addams family, lurch, unidentified grandmother, Wednesday's fiancée and his parents and on top of all that a background chorus of 8(?) ghosts of Addams family past. All did very well with at time an overwhelming amount of things to look at with everyone committing to their own performances.
