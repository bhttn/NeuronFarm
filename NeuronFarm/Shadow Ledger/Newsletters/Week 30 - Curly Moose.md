### Entertainment
**Edge of Tomorrow:** A fantastic film. Spends the perfect amount of time on the science, none, and great acting by Cruise & Blunt. Seeing the emotional journey both characters go on, mostly shown not told really elevate the movie.

**Jurassic World: Dominon** The sense of awe and wonder captured in the scene where the brachiosaurus walks through the logging camp is a high point the series has not reached since the first movie. Seeing the dinosaurs in the real world amount familiar surrounding would have been a great chance to show how magnificent any large creature is. The whole sub plot with Grant & Sadler is still the weakest part of the film and despite it being good to see them again little would of been lost if they wheren't in it and it would have made for a tighter movie. Still enjoy watching it, especially with Bran.

**Late Watch:** Found the perfect watch

### Science
**Ankylosaurus Find:** A fully intact Nodosaur, an ankylosaur with a straight tail has been found in a Canadian mine. It is suspected that it died in a river floating down to the sea in a flood before sinking to the ocean floor. This would explain its remarkable preservation as there would be little chance of scavengers attacking it before it sank into the sediment.
Excavation from the mine took 14 days before senior technician spent the next 5 and a half years separating rock from the fossil. All in it too 7 hours a day, 7000 hours total to finish this work.

**Space Potato:** Can you cook a potato by dropping it from space? No, worst case scenario it experiences a max temp of 150c but only for a few minutes, best case it reaches 1500c but for an even shorter period of time leaving the middle room temp by the time it reaches the ground. Either way because of the low temps in the upper atmosphere it spends most of its time at 17c with the re-entry temps lasting for only a brief period at the start. 

### Family
**Health:** Benita has had a mild cold but has been holding up ok so far. 

**Under 8s Day:** Bradley made it through the day even though he is starting to get a cold. Sounds like he had a good day and I'm glad he could go.

**HQ Upgrades:** I have mostly finished the long neglected final part of the surrounding gardens. Brad insisted on helping move the mulch even though I wasn't planning on doing it yet. Hunger got him in the end and he wanted to stop, one wheel barrow load from finished it. 

### Work
**P1:** Nice full DB outage to start the week. Multiple monitoring failures
