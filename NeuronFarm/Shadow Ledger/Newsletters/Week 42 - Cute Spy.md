## Entertainment
### The Bear
Like a wish from a genie what happens when you get what you want but not in the way you expected? 
### Mind MGMT
A mystery backed up by fantastic art and story telling. 
### The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent 
So much fun. Cage gives a surprisingly  nuanced performance considerering he was essentially playing himself. Manages to stick the landing even as the plot gets increasingly meta.
### Make It So
So far a more interesting look at what it was like growing up in the North of England in the 1940's & 50's then the early history of Stewart.
