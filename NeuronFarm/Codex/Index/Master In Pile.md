# Neutron Stars 
Take our sun, 1.4 million kilometers across, and shove its mass into a volume merely 20 kilometers in diam - eter. That is a neutron star. It is the densest object we know of made of ordinary matter, just a whisker away from a black hole.

A neutron star is born when an ordinary star is sufficiently massive, eight to 15 times as massive as the sun, has exhausted all its nuclear fuel and collapses to extreme densities. The outer layers of the star are blasted off into space as a supernova explosion, and the core remains as a neutron star.
