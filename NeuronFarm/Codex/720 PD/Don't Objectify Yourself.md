Go through the day focusing on things outside yourself, resisting judgment, and avoiding anything self-referential.

## Avoid Your Own Reflection
Try to keep from seeing yourself in how the world see you. Limit the amount of time you look at mirrors or pictures of your self in social media and remote calls.

## Judge Not
Try making purely observational statements rather than value based one. Less *"This coffee is terrible"* and more *"This coffee has a bitter flavour."*

## Stand in Awe
>  “the feeling of being in the presence of something vast that transcends your understanding of the world.”

Spend more time enjoying things that amaze you, go to the museum, listen to music that moves you, go for directionless walks, get in the car and go on a day trip with no set destination.
