# Overview
Your Weekly Review should accomplish three things to bring [[Chaos to Clarity]]

1.  **Clear your digital workspaces**: tidy up the virtual environment where you get things done
2.  **Update your available tasks**: update your to do’s based on new information that’s come in
3.  **Decide on your priorities for the week**: select a subset of to do’s that you are actively committing to for this week

# Order
1. **Email**: emails from other people
2. **Calendar**: calls and meetings at specific times
3.  **Notes**: digital notes I’ve saved
4. **Tasks**: my to do’s

# Guide
## Email
Touch each email only once, as you clear them they will flow into the next steps.
## Calendar 
This is the "hard landscape" of the day, things that must be done at a certain time. Scan two weeks in the past for follow up items and four weeks into the future for things that need to be prepared for. 
## Notes
As you complete the first steps new notes will be created, this step organises the notes into the notebook and tasks can be created for follow up. 
## Tasks
The task list will now contain a comprehensive list of tasks representing the most important priorities for the week. Each task should be processed so that it contains 
- What the next action is, be as clear as possible
- What priority it is; high priority for things that must be done this week
- Which project or area it falls under

## Task List
Filter the tasks by priority and choose the ones to focus on this week. What can I take action on, what do I need to take action on and what do I want to take action on. 

By having all the potential tasks I could possibly choose from laid out in front of me in one view, each one succinct and clear, this process is _vastly_ easier than it would be otherwise.

# Conclusion 
At this point, I can put to rest all my fears about what I might be missing. I can sit down and focus on doing my best work, because my mind is completely dedicated to the task at hand, not keeping track of open loops in the background.
