The secret is using a simple framework: Present, past, and future.

## Present
Start with a present-tense statement to introduce yourself:

_Hi, I’m Ashley and I’m a software engineer. My current focus is optimizing customer experience._

## Past
This is where you can add two or three points that will provide people with relevant details about your background. It is also your opportunity to establish credibility. Consider your education and other credentials, past projects, employers, and accomplishments.

_My background is in computer science. Before joining this team, I worked with big data to identify insights for our clients in the health care industry._

## Future
This is your opportunity to demonstrate enthusiasm for what’s ahead. If you’re in a job interview, you could share your eagerness about opportunities at the firm. If you’re in a meeting, you could express interest in the meeting topic. If you’re kicking off a project with a new team, you could talk about how excited you are, or share your goals for the project.

_I’m honored to be here. This project is a significant opportunity for all of us._

_I’m excited to work with you all to solve our clients’ biggest challenges!_
