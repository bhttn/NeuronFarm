### Gray Rock
Gray Rock is a sandstone outcrop that was a stopping point for Cobb and Co in the 1870s. The site originally had a hotel which was a changing point for the coach horses. The visiting public and some locals have carved their names on the sandstone rock leaving a lasting and interesting history of the travellers to the region. A small amount of aboriginal art can be found on the rock. There is a private property called Gray Rock, please refer to the historical signs for the turn off point for the historical site.

### Horsetailer’s Gorge
Horsetailer’s Gorge was once used as a camping spot by drovers. The sides of the gorge form a natural barrier that kept their horses from wandering at night. The gorge and surrounding area contain examples of classic Western Queensland desert and range country. Some of the trees in the area have been identified with marking tags to help visitors learn more about the local vegetation

### Lake Dunn
The drive to the lake encompasses a single lane bitumen road through a variety of different types of terrain including part of the Aramac Range. Follow the signs to Lake Dunn Water Sports, not Lake Dunn (which is a private property), until you reach the camping area. Enjoy the camping facilities including toilets, power, hot and cold showers and the relaxing day shed. Waterfront cabins can also be reserved for an overnight stay or set the caravan up wherever you please along the water’s edge.
