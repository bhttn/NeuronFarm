Once upon a time, in a land of green and blue, A tornado came out of the sky, as wild as can be. It whirled and it swirled, it spun round and round, As it tore through the town, without making a sound.

Houses and trees, it lifted and tossed, Like they were mere toys, that the wind had bossed. The people all ran, in fear and in fright, But the tornado just laughed, with all of its might.

It danced through the streets, with a mighty twist, Leaving destruction and debris, in its mist. But just as it seemed, that all hope was lost, A brave little boy, stood up to the tornado, at any cost.

With a loud, brave voice, he shouted out, "Stop! You may be powerful, but you can't take our hope!" And to the boy's surprise, the tornado paused, It looked at the boy, with curiosity and awe.

It realized that it had caused enough harm, And with a final twirl, it dissipated and was gone. The town breathed a sigh of relief, and came out to see, The brave little boy, who had saved them, with bravery.
