## Ingredients 
QTY | Desc
---|---
175g |white spelt flour
1 tbsp |baking powder
55g | caster (superfine) sugar
1 |egg
250ml | milk
1 tsp | vanilla extract (my secret trick)
40g |unsalted butter, melted

## Method
1. Place the flour, baking powder and sugar in a big bowl and mix to combine, using a whisk.
2. Break the egg into a medium jug. Add the milk, vanilla and melted butter and whisk to combine.
3. Using a spoon, dig a well in the centre of the flour mixture. Pour the egg mixture into the well, then whisk it all together to make a smooth batter.
4. Heat a large, lightly greased non-stick fryingpan over medium heat. Using a ladle or a cup, add about ¼ cup (60ml) of the batter to the pan for each pancake. Cook pancakes for 1-2 minutes each side or until they re golden, using a turner to flip them.
5. Stack and serve the pancakes warm from the pan with some natural yoghurt, maple syrup and berries (or your own favourite toppings). MAKES 8
