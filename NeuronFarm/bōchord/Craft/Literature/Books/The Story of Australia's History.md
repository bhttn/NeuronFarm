Chapter One
We view personal possessions partly as a
sign of our material success, but to Aborigines they were a burden.
Somebody had to carry them. That their groups moved to new sites
was an indication of their knowledge and skill. In moving camp
and winning a living from a variety of botanical environments they
faced reality rather than evaded it. In moving around they were not
creatures of whim but of purpose; their wanderings were systematic.

### Ch 8:  Dual & Battle
William Buckley
Lloyd Warner - A Black Civilisation
Josephine Flood

Although small in scale the proportion of people affected by raids/feuds was high, especially when the women and children where targeted as the did most of the food gathering. Conflict seems to have been widespread and devestating when it occurred. 

### Ch 9: The Days Hunt
Spending the days alone hunting geese nests, coming together at night with a few other men from the tribe, the silence of the swamps, the solitude, what was that like? What did they talk about? How did they not go mad?

### Ch 10: women of the plains and mountains 
Surprisingly little attention was paid to Palmer's essay. How the Aborigines
made their living was of less interest than which deity they believed in, whom they married and how they structured their society.

The reliance on meat or plant-foods, and the relative role of
women or men as the main food collectors, were crucial questions
for the increasing regiment of scholars who studied Aboriginal
ways of life.

### Ch 11: Medicines and drugs,
liquids and cosmetics

The average Australian adult and ten-year-old child knew more
about botany 1000 years ago than they know today. Knowledge of
botany supplied them not only with much of their food but also
with drugs and medicines and - in a drought - with water.

In Tasmania a cider eucalypt in season yielded a stimulating
drink. Rather like a blue gum in appearance, the tree grew in the
bracing climate of the central plateau, fourishing mostly where
forest met open country.

## Ch 20: white ghosts ride by
Dick Roughsey, one of the first Aborigines to write a book
but his people, could recount his own father's recollections of the
roning of Europeans to a small island in the Gulf of Carpentaria.
