## What I expect / know
- A great amoung science fiction stories
- Soviet (Ukranianian?)
- Grim
- Spawned a well like Game series
- Contains a forbidden Chernobyl like "zone" where the aliens/artefacts are

## Chapter 1
- Classic noir / old school scifi narrating everything that is happening from 1st person perspective
- Didn’t expect it to be set in small town America with an international cast
- So far reminds me of a classic Assimov/Philip K Dick short story
- Good but not great
