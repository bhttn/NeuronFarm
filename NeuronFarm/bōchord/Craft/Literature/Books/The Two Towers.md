Death was ever present, because the Númenoreans stül.
as they had in their old kingdom, and so lost it, hungered
after endless life unchanging. Kings made tombs more splen-
did than houses of the living, and counted old names in the
rolls of their descent dearer than the names of sons. Childless
lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry; in secret chambers
withered men compounded strong elixirs, or in high cold
towers asked questions of the stars.
