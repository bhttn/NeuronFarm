**I danced in the morning when the world was begun,  
And I danced in the moon and the stars and the sun,  
And I came down from heaven and I danced on the earth:  
At Bethlehem I had my birth.**

_Dance, then, wherever you may be,_  
_I am the Lord of the dance, said he,_  
_And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be,_  
_And I'll lead you all in the dance, said he._

I danced for the scribe and the Pharisee,  
But they would not dance and they wouldn't follow me;  
I danced for the fishermen, for James and John;  
They came with me and the dance went on:

_Dance, then, wherever you may be,_  
_I am the Lord of the dance, said he,_  
_And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be,_  
_And I'll lead you all in the dance, said he._

I danced on the Sabbath and I cured the lame:  
The holy people said it was a shame.  
They whipped and they stripped and they hung me on high,  
And they left me there on a cross to die:

_Dance, then, wherever you may be,_  
_I am the Lord of the dance, said he,_  
_And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be,_  
_And I'll lead you all in the dance, said he._

**I danced on a Friday when the sky turned black;  
It's hard to dance with the devil on your back.  
They buried my body and they thought I'd gone;  
But I am the dance, and I still go on:**

_Dance, then, wherever you may be,_  
_I am the Lord of the dance, said he,_  
_And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be,_  
_And I'll lead you all in the dance, said he._

**They cut me down and I leapt up high;  
I am the life that'll never, never die.  
I'll live in you if you'll live in me:  
I am the Lord of the dance, said he.**

_Dance, then, wherever you may be,_  
_I am the Lord of the dance, said he,_  
_And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be,_  
_And I'll lead you all in the dance, said he._
