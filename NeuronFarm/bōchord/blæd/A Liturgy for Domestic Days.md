"A Liturgy for Domestic Days" from Every Moment Holy

  

Many are the things that must be daily done.  
Meet me therefore, O Lord,  
in the doing of the small, repetitive tasks,  
In the cleaning and ordering and  
maintenance and stewardship of things—  
of dishes, of floors, of carpets  
and toilets and tubs,  
of scrubbing and sweeping  
and dusting and laundering—  
That by such stewardship I might bring  
a greater order to my own life,  
and to the lives of any I am given to serve,  
so that in those ordered spaces  
bright things might flourish:  
fellowship and companionship,  
creativity and conversation,  
learning and laughter  
and enjoyment and health.  
As I steward the small, daily tasks,  
may I remember these good ends,  
and so discover in my labors  
the promise of the eternal hopes  
that underlie them.  
High King of Heaven,  
you showed yourself among us  
as the servant of all,  
speaking stories of a kingdom to come,  
a kingdom in which those who  
spend themselves for love,  
even in the humblest of services,  
will not be forgotten,  
but whose every service lovingly rendered  
will be seen from that far vantage  
as the planting of a precious seed  
blooming into eternity.  
  
And so I offer this small service to you, O Lord,  
for you make no distinction between  
those acts that bring a person  
the wide praise of their peers  
and those unmarked acts  
that are accomplished in a quiet obedience  
without accolade.  
You see instead the heart, the love,  
and the faithful stewardship  
of all labors, great and small.  
And so, in your loving presence,  
I undertake this task.  
O God, grant that my heart  
might be ordered aright,  
knowing that all good service  
faithfully rendered  
is first a service rendered unto you.  
Receive then this my service,  
that even in the midst of labors that  
hold no happiness in themselves,  
I might have increasing joy.  
  
Amen.
