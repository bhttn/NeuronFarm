## Agile Overview
Agile is a structured and iterative approach to project management and product development. It recognizes the volatility of product development, and provides a methodology for self-organizing teams to respond to change without going off the rails. 

### Scrum
Scrum teams commit to completing an increment of work, which is potentially shippable, through set intervals called sprints. Their goal is to create learning loops to quickly gather and integrate customer feedback. 

1. A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.
2. The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.
3. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.
4. _Repeat_

### Kanban
Kanban is all about visualizing your work, limiting work in progress, and maximizing efficiency (or flow). Kanban teams focus on reducing the time a project takes (or user story) from start to finish. They do this by using a kanban board and continuously improving their flow of work. 

#### Kanban Cards
A kanban card is a visual representation of an item of work. It’s an essential component of the kanban method, a work management framework that helps visualize work, limit work in progress (WIP), and maximize efficiency (or flow). Each kanban card represents a single work item as it moves through various stages of completion which are represented on either a physical or virtual kanban board.

For agile teams, each card could encapsulate one user story. Once on the board, these visual signals help teammates and stakeholders quickly understand what the team is working on.

#### Work Flows
Another hallmark of the kanban board are the columns. Each column represents a specific activity that together compose a “workflow”. Cards flow through the workflow until completion. Workflows can be as simple as “To Do,” “In Progress,” “Complete,” or much more complex.

## Kanban vs Scrum
Kanban aims to give team members just enough work so the team is consistently working at capacity. Teams that practice kanban benefit from flexible planning, clearer focus, and total transparency because whatever’s on the board is the top priority. That’s what developers are working on. Kanban is great for operational teams focused on continuous delivery with changing priorities.

By contrast,sscrum divides work into a series of fixed-length iterations called sprints; whatever is scheduled for a sprint is the team’s top priority (e.g. a particular feature or group of features). Product teams with a clear roadmap and prioritized chunks of work typically benefit most from scrum.
