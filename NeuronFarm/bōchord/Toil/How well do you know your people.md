Some questions to ask yourself
- Do I know the personal and career aspirations of each of my team members?
- Do I know why they joined the ATO and why they took their current position?
- What are their strengths and areas for improvement?
- Do they understand how their role affects the team and the organisation more broadly?
- Are they proud of being in my team?
- How do they feel about their work/life balance?
- How do they prefer to give and receive feedback?
- How do they prefer to receive recognition?
