### Part 1, Between Nihilism and Idolatry
- Humans are inherently religious and worshipping creatures, seeking ultimate concerns that imbue life with purpose and meaning.
- Sinful and broken human nature leads to the co-option of the sacred to justify self-interests, nationalistic ideologies, and group superiority over others.
- Idolatry, where God is used to legitimize personal agendas, is presented as the default and perpetual state, supported by scriptural examples.
- The pervasive idolatry tempts many to reject religion from public life, seeking a purely secular politics based on humanistic ideals.
- However, removing the sacred from public life leads to nihilism, characterized by a lack of meaning, purpose, and existential desolation.
- Nihilism creates a hunger for meaning, making individuals more vulnerable to ideological radicalization and its associated temptations toward violence.
- The Christian political witness is characterized as a navigation between idolatry (the default state of self-interested worship) and nihilism (the void created by removing the sacred).
