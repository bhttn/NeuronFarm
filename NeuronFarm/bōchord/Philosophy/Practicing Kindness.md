## Kindness
> Adopting an attitude of kindness does not suggest that we turn a blind eye to the less-than-charitable behavior of others. It does suggest, however, that we not allow others’ lack of charity to affect our disposition.
> Kindness is shown through actions. When we refer to someone as being kind, it is usually in response to a gesture or action of goodness that was unmerited by the recipient.
> Christians are called to show kindness—to perform acts that are intrinsically good even, and especially, when those acts are unmerited and go unreciprocated.
