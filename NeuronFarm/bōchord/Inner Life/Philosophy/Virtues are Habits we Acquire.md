We want people to be more kind so we tell everyone, "Be kind." We want people to stoping stressing out so we say, "Don't worry." We want people to love more and say, "Love others." All we do is push imperatives. Do this. Be that.

**Virtues are habits we acquire, not choices we make at the point of a command.** Trouble is, we tend to get stuck on the commands. We tell people how they _should_ think, feel or behave but never get around to the practices that turn these imperatives into virtues.
