## 1. Don't let up on them.
Set high expectations, and be consistent in your messaging, even when you get eye-rolling (or worse) in reply.
## 2. Praise them For efforts 
it's far more effective over time to praise kids for the effort they put into things, as opposted to their innate abilities.
-   Not something like: "You're such a good painter!"
-   But instead, "I am so impressed by the effort you put into that painting, and it turned out so beautifully!"
## 3.  Make them do chores.
two keys that people need in order to be happy and successful:

1. Love.   
2. Work ethic.

I'll bet you could sweep the floor more easily and faster, right?

Insist that they do it anyway. It's not just about having a clean floor. It's about learning to have a happy life.
