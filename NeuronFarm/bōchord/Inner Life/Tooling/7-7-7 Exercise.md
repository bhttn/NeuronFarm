## 7 Months

## 7 Days
You reach the final week of your life. You now have 7 days to live. What would you do with the last 7 days of your life? How would you spend your time? Who would you make sure to see? Is there anything you feel like you would need to do to feel complete?

## 7 Hours

# Reflection
## Questions
- How would you spend your time? 
- Who would you make sure to see? Is there anything you feel like you would need to do to feel complete?
## Review
How did it feel to think about the fact that you will die someday? Did you notice any patterns of what you prioritized as your time became more and more limited? What was most important to you, when you realized you didn’t have much time left? What might this say about your values and what is ultimately most important to you? How are these values reflected (or not) in your day-to-day life?
