# Overview
A brain dump is when you gather all your disorganized thoughts and, appropriately, _dump_ them onto a blank canvas. This exercise allows you to clear your mind and pave the way for new, creative ideas. You let all your thoughts tumble onto paper, and see what you come up with after the process.

# Process
1. Start with a blank paper or digital note
2. Record all your ideas for things you want to get done.
3. Take a moment to double check if anything is missing
4. Rank each idea/task by priority and category
5. Organise with what you can start now
